# Development

Since it's not the smartest thing to post the code for everyone to see, I'll write you my approach and some of the projects I've worked on.

### Dev Approach

In order for the solutions I work on to be scalable, some of the steps I follow from the very start are:

- Product understanding,
- Detailed architecture design,
- File organization
- Adherence to naming convention

#### Product understanding
Understanding the product involves deep analysis of business needs, user requirements, and project goals. This phase includes gathering and documenting all relevant information that shapes the software solution development. It includes understanding the target audience, key functionalities, user experience, and technical constraints.

#### Detailed Architecture Design
Detailed architecture design involves planning the system structure, defining components and their interactions. This includes creating system diagrams, selecting technologies, planning scalability, security, and reliability. The architecture is designed to enable easy maintenance, expansion, and integration with existing systems.

#### File Organization
File organization entails structuring all project files in a logical and clear manner. This involves defining folders for different types of files (e.g., source code, configuration files, documentation, tests). Well-organized file structure facilitates project development, maintenance, scalability, and team collaboration.

#### Adherence to naming convention
Sticking to naming conventions helps maintain consistency and readability in the code. Naming conventions define how variables, functions, and files should be named. When everyone uses the same rules, the code becomes more intuitive and easier to maintain.
