Hello. My name is Nenad, a creative problem solver. Through this document, I will take you through my experience in the IT industry spanning almost a decade.

With experience and skills gained through application development, I have also been involved in mentoring newbies. Mentoring four individuals, three of whom are working as successful developers while the fourth is on the way to becoming one, I further developed and improved skills in effective communication, project management, organization and teamwork. Those skills helped me later when I became a team leader.
