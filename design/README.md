# Design

Everything generally starts from here, so it is important to do it in as much detail as possible.

The design approach is done in several stages.

- Discovery Phase
- Visual Direction
- Structural Planning
- Detailed Design

#### Discovery Phase: Product Insight and Competitive Analysis
The discovery phase is critical for laying the groundwork for a successful project. This stage involves a comprehensive analysis of the product, market, and competition. By conducting thorough research, teams gain valuable insights into current trends, customer needs, and competitive advantages.

#### Visual Direction: Style Guide & Moodboard
In this phase, a moodboard is created to explore and finalize the visual direction. After the concept is approved, a style guide is developed to ensure visual consistency across the website. The style guide evolves alongside the homepage design and is finalized once the homepage is approved.

#### Structural Planning: Sitemap & Wireframes
This stage involves defining the websiteâ€™s structure by listing the pages and their respective sections. Wireframes are created as blueprints to guide the design process, helping to determine how information is presented on each page and section.

#### Detailed Design: Page Layouts
During the detailed design phase, the approved style and moodboard concepts are applied to create the final layouts of the pages. This includes organizing typography, imagery, iconography, and the overall layout as defined in the wireframing phase.
